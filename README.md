# Server Model Composer

A frontend application that helps users determine possible Server Model Options based on their selected hardware configurations.

## Overview

This application provides an intuitive interface for users to:

1. Input Section: Where users can specify their hardware requirements
2. Output Section: Displays the matching Server Models after submission

## Features

- Interactive hardware configuration input
- Real-time validation of user inputs
- Clear display of matching Server Models
- User-friendly interface with clear separation between input and output sections
- Built with Material-UI (MUI) for a modern, responsive design
- Comprehensive unit tests for reliable functionality
- TypeScript for enhanced type safety and better developer experience
